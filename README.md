Month 2 – Data Analytics Learning Journey
Weeks 5 to 8 | End-to-End Business Data Analysis

This repository documents my Month 2 progress in data analytics, covering advanced data processing, statistical analysis, visualization, and an end-to-end business case study.
All work is implemented in Python (Jupyter Notebooks), Pandas, Seaborn, Plotly, and Scikit-Learn using real datasets.
